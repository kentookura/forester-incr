(* I was inspired to play around with the ideas in
    https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.08775.

   I was thinking about incrementally rendering forests. The question is: Which
   changes affect which trees?

   Let S_addr be the set of trees changeable by modifying tree at `addr`. Then
   { tree with transclusion path to `addr` } âŠ‚ S_addr, since S would need to be
   rerendered.

   However, trees which query a forest are more tricky. How can we tell if an
   edit action on a tree causes it to be matched/dropped by a query? If I
   change the taxon from t_1 to t_2, all trees which query for t_1 and t_2 must
   be rerendered.

   I thought that it might be convenient to have a datastructure for storing
   query results that is indexed by the type of queries itself. While I
   succeeded in creating this datastructure (so far with just a lookup
   function), it did open up a new issue, which I now illustrate:

   The constructors Isect and Union store a list of queries. The search result
   is independent of the list order. That's why I used a map indexed by
   query-sets instead:

   lookup (Isect [q1; q2]) == lookup (Isect [q2; q1])

   What if we wish to take equivalence of queries more seriously? Normal form?
   Confluence? Use some theorems about boolean algebra? Some stuff along these
   lines is discussed in the paper in the pattern matching section.

   Leaving these questions aside for a moment, it is easy to see the appeal of
   this:

   * First, we could write algorithms to incrementally render forests,
   combining the structures and functions in this file with the query engine..
   In a hypermedia environment, we could just rerender the currently viewed
   tree, but if we incorporate incrementality into static rendering, we need to
   make sure everything that needs rerendering actually gets rerendered.

   * We could build a pretty sophisticated search engine using this. When
   computing new query results, we could combine existing cached results with
   fresh search results, or even avoid searching the forest by simply combining
   existing results.

  type t = query

  let compare = compare

  let compare = compare
end)

module Query_set = Set.Make (struct
  type t = query

  let compare = compare
end)

module Relation_set = Set.Make (struct
  type t = rel

  let compare = compare

(* This smells, feel like we should have a trie for this *)
